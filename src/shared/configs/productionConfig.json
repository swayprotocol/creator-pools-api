First, make sure you own some $SWAY in your Metamask wallet. <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x262b8aa7542004f023b0eb02bc6b96350a02b728'>Get $SWAY here &gt;</a> NOTE: Currently we only support creator pools on Polygon network.</p><p>Click on Stake and a pop-up will appear. Select the channel and provide the creator's identificator. Ie. on channel 'Instagram' you can stake with a creator with the handle @metaverse. We don't validate entries, so make sure there's no typos.</p><p>And yes, that means you get to stake with any account you wish -- even if the creator hasn't claimed his pool yet.</p>"

        "title": "Why should I stake?",
        "content": "<p>Every pool needs to be claimed by the original creator in order to start paying out rewards. However, here's two reasons why you should start staking today.</p><p>1) PROMOTIONAL PERIOD. The first generation staking pool offers a promotional APR of up to 444% instead of direct returns from NFT sales. <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://medium.com/cloutdotart/444-apr-promotion-alert-stake-in-the-new-creator-pools-a42e44f8ce4c'>Read more</a>.</p><p>2) BEING FIRST PAYS OFF. The first position in the pool gets the most favorable terms and yields better rewards. You can sit at the top position forever. Might be a smart idea to be the first to stake with @garyvee or beeple.eth...?</p><p>If a creator doesn't claim his pool, you can simply withdraw your stake after the promotional period. Click on Unstake to begin the withdrawal process.</p>"
